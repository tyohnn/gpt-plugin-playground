 * The foot of a form that scrolls: a note (when it was last saved) and the buttons, staying at the bottom of the
 * scrolling pane over a hairline. Inside a padded pane, pull it over the padding with `className`
 * (`-bottom-4 pb-4` for a pane with `p-4`).
 *
 * The footer does not name a surface colour of its own. It reads the surface it floats on: the system's glass
 * fill where floating surfaces are glass (with its own blur, which hides the form scrolling under it — the
 * panel's blur hides what is behind the panel), and the popover colour everywhere else, where the filter is none.
