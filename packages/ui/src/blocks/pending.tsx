 * The place of a text value before the value arrives. A block that is `loading` swaps only its value slots — a
 * title, a figure, a name — for this, and keeps its frame, so nothing moves when the value comes.
 *
 * - The bar's height is not a number: invisible glyphs fill it, so it is as tall as the slot's font size and sits
 *   in the middle of the line (`leading-none`, `align-middle`), inside the line box the text would make. The line
 *   keeps the height it has with text in it. Only the width is estimated, in characters (`length`).
 * - It is a `<span>`, so it fits wherever text does (a `<p>`, a heading, a table cell); the Skeleton component is
 *   a `<div>` and would not. It wears the same layer-3 class (`cn-skeleton`), so the system colours it.
 * - It is hidden from assistive technology; the block's own frame says `aria-busy` while it waits.
